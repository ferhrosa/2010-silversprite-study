# 2010 - SilverSprite study

Project made in 2010 using:
* [ASP.NET WebForms](https://www.asp.net/web-forms)
* [Silverlight 5](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/)
* [SilverSprite](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=silversprite)

SilverSprite was a work in progress library made to port 2D XNA games to the web, using the Silverlight runtime.

This project is just a little study, and does not have anything really finished.
